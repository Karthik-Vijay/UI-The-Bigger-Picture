## Stick to static URLs whenever possible. Visitors will remember these, and search bots can interpret them more easily.
## Avoid numbers, dates and other unnecessary jargon. When you use these in a URL, it dilutes the overall value of other keywords you are using in the URL of a page.
## Always use a hyphen (-) to separate keywords in a URL. Avoid other separators, such as an underscore, a plus sign or combination of other special characters.
## Use as few words as possible in the URL. After four or five words, search engines won’t consider the rest of the words for evaluation. And consumers do not have the tolerance for long search words.
## The best URL is the one that describes the intent of the page and is clear, short, and sticks in the visitor’s mind.

Examples to avoid:

http://www.betterFuture.com/plant trees/

Underscores (_) are not considered a space to search engines. Therefore, dashes (-) should be used in URLs to separate keywords.

Using parameters on URLs (?attribute=value) is most damaging when content on the page is not consistent with the attribute/value match.
http://www.betterFuture.com/carbon-less-world-landing-page-2015/

Users would not typically search for terms like “landing page” or “2015” making these unnecessary identifiers for search engines.
http://www.betterFuture.com/carbonlessworld/
Without the use of dashes (-) search engines cannot identify individual words. Essentially this URL is optimized for a user searching “electricsnowblowers” as one word, versus the more likely search of “electric snow blowers”.
